#Breakout
My first java project - a version of the classic Atari game Breakout!

#Fun Features
Easily configurable (in game code header):

Balls - count, size, speed

Paddles - count, width, speed

Physics - bounciness, paddle velocity effects, friction, acceleration

Scores - by brick, level, speed

Bricks - layout, size

Images - faces, friends, colors

...and more!

#Why is this here?
In case I need a fun thing to show friends getting into coding!
